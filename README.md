# 🚧 THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! 🚧

Stackalog is a Swiss 🇨🇭 inventory management app, so expect the German language 🇩🇪 and the Frank currency 💸.  
It allows you to log your inventory items (called logs 📦) and create folders (called stacks 🗂️).  
You can then **stack** your **logs** – in other words, create folders, *BUT* one log can be in many stacks.  
These stacks with logs are your catalog – *cough cough* I mean, your stackalog. 😏
